              <span class="section-price d-block">¬£99 60 MIN SESSION</span>
              <span class="section-price d-block">¬£178 2x 60 MIN SESSION (-¬£20)</span>
              <span class="section-price d-block">¬£257 3x 60 MIN SESSION (-¬£40)</span>
              <span class="section-optional-title">Note: this session price includes our prep time and bespoke materials sent to you as follow up üôá‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è</span>
              <p>We know there are a lot of questions when it comes to portfolios. How many projects? Do I need to write a case study? How much is enough? Or too much? Which projects should I leave out? What should I focus on? That‚Äôs why we love a live, in-person review - precisely so you can ask your own questions and we can give truly personal advice. </p>
              <p>We will prepare for the session by looking at any portfolio PDF or website you send us, along with any details of the type of studios or companies you‚Äôre looking to apply to. We will shape the session to give mostly broad and universally applicable advice (so if you change your mind your hard work won't be wasted) with some time given to specifics if you know them. The more you put in, the more you get out! </p>
              <p>Don't forget, accountability is a good thing - book a session now, as having a portfolio-ready deadline  can combat the inertia that goes hand in hand with the job search üí™</p>
                
              <span class="section-sub-title">We'll ask for:</span>

                  <li>Have you done any design challenges, and what were your outputs for those?</li>
                </ul>

                <span class="section-sub-title">We'll give you:</span>

          <p>There are times when we all feel something needs to change - whether you‚Äôre disillusioned with your current career path, trying to level-up in your role, or thinking of a sideways transition - having a conversation with an experienced third party can be cathartic and clarifying.</p>

          <p>Our coaching is effective because it is objective focussed, and empowers you to find your own answers. We understand that people's lives are busy - with an empathetic and experienced coach to drill into ideas with, this coaching will give you a sense of accountability and therefore permission to spend time on yourself. This will help you foster an achievement habit and structured systems for your continuous growth.</p>
